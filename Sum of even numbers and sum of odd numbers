Sum of even numbers and sum of odd numbers
Arun and Kalai were playing a puzzle game with a given set of numbers. They need to find the odd and even numbers and find the sum of the odd numbers and the sum of the even numbers. Write a program to help them to solve the puzzle game and to win the mobile phone.
Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. 

The first integer corresponds to ‘n’, the size of the array. 

The next ‘n’ integers correspond to the elements in the array. 

Assume that the maximum value of n is 15.

Output Format:

Refer to sample output for details.

Sample Input:

5

2

3

6

8

-1

Sample Output:

The sum of the even numbers in the array is 16

The sum of the odd numbers in the array is 2




#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
  int in1,in2[15],i,sume=0,sumo=0;
  cin>>in1;
  for(i=0;i<in1;i++)
  {
	cin>>in2[i];
  }
  for(i=0;i<in1;i++)
  {
	if(in2[i]%2==0)
    {
      sume+=in2[i];
    }
    else
    {
		sumo+=in2[i];
    }
  }
  cout<<"The sum of the even numbers in the array is "<<sume<<"\n";
  cout<<"The sum of the odd numbers in the array is "<<sumo;
}
